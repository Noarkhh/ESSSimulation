# Simulation of animal behavior patterns in context of evolutionary stable strategies.

Evolutionary Stable Strategy (or ESS; also evolutionarily stable strategy): A behavioral strategy (phenotype) if adopted 
by all individuals in a population that cannot be replaced or invaded by a different strategy through natural 
selection.[^1] In game-theoretical terms, an ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium, being a Nash 
equilibrium that is also "evolutionarily stable."[^2]
